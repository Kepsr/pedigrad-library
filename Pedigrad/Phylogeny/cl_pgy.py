'''
This class possesses one object, namely
- .phylogeneses (Phylogenesis item)
and ten methods, namely
- .__init__ (constructor)
- .coalescent
- .extend
- .count_uniformity
- .boolean_partition
- .make_friends
- .set_up_friendships
- .score
- .choose_friends
- .set_up_competition
- .score_dominance
- .choose_dominants



The object .phylogenesis is supposed to contained a list of Phylogenesis items.
The taxon associated with the i-th phylogenesis should be indexed by the interger i itself and any label appearing in the Phylogenesis items of the list should have its own Phylogenesis item in the list.



The constructor .__init__ takes a list of lists of lists containing indices and use every internal list of the input to create a Phylogenesis item, which is stored in the object .phylogeneses.



The method .coalescent() returns the list of the first generations (i.e the last lists) of the objects .history of each of the Phylogenesis item contained in the object .phylogeneses. The k-th list of the output is the first generation of the history of taxon k. 



The method .extend takes a list of pairs of the form (t,l) where t is the label of a taxon and l is a list of taxa and updates the object .phylogeneses as follows:
--> for all pairs (t,l) contained in the input passed to .extend:
1) if every list l contains the last list of self.phylogeneses[t].history and if at least one of the lists l strictly contains the last list of
self.phylogeneses[t].history, then every list l is appended to the list self.phylogeneses[t].history and the value True is returned;
  2) if there is no strict inclusion of the last list of self.phylogeneses[t].history into l, then the object .phylogeneses is not modified and the value False is returned;
  3) otherwise, an error message is returned and the procedure exit the program;
--> in any terminating case, for all other taxa t of the phylogeny that do not appear in the input of .extend, the last list of self.phylogeneses[t].history (i.e. the first generation of the history of the phylogenesis of t) is again repeated (i.e. appended again) in the list self.phylogeneses[t].history.



The method .make_friends takes the label of a taxon (i.e. a non-negative integer) and returns a pair of lists (friends,hypothesis). The list 'friends' contains all those taxa that have not coalesced with the input taxon, which means that there are not in the first generation of phylogenesis of the taxon. while the list 'hypothesis' contains the lists obtained by making the union of the first generation of the input taxon with the first generation of one of the taxon in 'friends'.



The method .set_up_friendships() returns a pair of lists (friendships,hypotheses) containing the lists of the two different outputs of the method .make_friends for every taxon of the phylogeny. More specifically, 
  - 'friendships' is the list of lists whose i-th list contains the first output of the procedure self.make_friends for taxon i;
  - 'hypotheses'  is the list of lists whose i-th list contains the second output of the procedure self.make_friends for taxon i;




The method .score takes a list of lists of non-negative integers (i.e. partitions) and a pair of lists, say (friendships,hypotheses), where
  - friendships is a list of lists;
  - hypotheses is a list of lenght len(friendships) whose t-th element is a
    list of length len(friendships[t]) whose elements are lists of integers
    ranging from 0 to len(self.phylogeneses)-1 (preferrably sorted from
    smallest to greatest);
and returns a list of length len(friendships) whose t-th element is a list of triples of the form (r,large,exact) where
  - r runs over the elements of friendships[t],
  - 'large' is the large score [4] of the hypothetical ancestor 
    hypotheses[t][r] within the set of ancestors contained in 
    hypotheses[t] for the list of partitions given in the input,
  - 'exact' is the exact score [4] of the hypothetical ancestor 
    hypotheses[t][r] within the set of ancestors contained in 
    hypotheses[t] for the list of partitions given in the input.

This means that 'large' is the number of partitions belonging to the first input list for which there is a morphism of partition x.quotient() -> partitions[i]
where we take

x = EquivalenceRelation([hypotheses[t][r]],len(self.phylogeneses)-1)

and 'exact' is the number of partitions that were counted in the large score of r such that if these partitions belong to the large score of any other element s in friendships[t], then either the equality hypotheses[t][r] = hypotheses[t][s] holds or the intersection of hypotheses[t][r] with hypotheses[t][s] is empty.
The second input of the method .score can, for instance, be taken to be the output of the procedure self.set_up_friendships().


The method .choose takes a list of lists of triples (r,l,e) where l and e are non-negative integers and returns a list of lists whose i-th list is the list of element r of the i-th internal list of the input list for which the associated pairs (l,e) are equal to the greatest local maxima of the function (e,l) -> (l,e) ordered by the lexicographical order and relative to the pairs of the i-th internal list of the input list.


The method .set_up_competition takes a list of lists of integers whose length must be equal to the length of self.phylogeneses (i.e. the number of taxa of the phylogeny) and returns a list of lists of integers whose length is also equal to the length of self.phylogeneses and whose t-th internal list is the union of the t-th list of self.coalescent() with the r-th lists of self.coalescent() for every element r in the t-th internal list of the input list.
