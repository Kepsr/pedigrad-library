#EquivalenceRelation: .classes, .range, .closure, .quotient
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''
This class possesses two objects, namely
- .classes (list of lists);
- .range (integer);
and three methods, namely
- .__init__ (constructor);
- .closure;
- .quotient.

The constructor .__init__ takes between 1 and 2 arguments: the first argument should either be an empty list or a list of lists of indices (i.e. non-negative integers) and the second argument, which is optional, should an integer that is greater than or equal to the maximum index contained in the first input. 

If the first input is not empty, then it is stored in the object .classes while the object .range receives 
- either the second input, when it is given;
- or the maximum index contained in the first input when no second input is given.

E.g.
eq1 = EquivalenceRelation([[0,1,2,9],[7,3,8,6],[4,9,5]])
eq2 = EquivalenceRelation([[0,1,2,9],[7,3,8,7],[9,15]],18)

If the first input is empty, then the second argument is required. In this case, the object .classes receive the lists containing all the singleton lists containing the integers from 0 to the integer given in the second argument, which is, for its part, stored in the object .range.

E.g.
eq3 = EquivalenceRelation([],5)
eq3.classes = [[0], [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]


The method .closure replaces the content of the object .classes with the transitive closure of its classes. After this procedure, the object .classes describes an actually equivalence relation (modulo the singleton equivalence classes, which do not need to be specified for obvious reasons).

eq1.closure() 
eq1.classes = [[7, 3, 8, 6], [4, 9, 5, 0, 1, 2]]
eq2.closure() 
eq2.classes = [[7, 3, 8], [9, 15, 0, 1, 2]]

The method .quotient() returns a list of integers whose length is equal to the integer stored in the object .range decreased by 1 and whose non-trivial fibers are those contained in the object .classes.

eq1.quotient() = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1] 
eq2.quotient() = [1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 10, 11, 12]
