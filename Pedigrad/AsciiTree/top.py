#tree_of_partitions(partitions): list of MorphismOfPartitions
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''
This function takes a list of partitions that can successively be related by morphisms of partitions and returns the actual lists of morphisms of partitions between these.

The input list should always start with the target of the first arrow, then present its source, which should also be the target of the next arrow, etc.

e.g.
if we set
a = [0,0,0,0,0,0]
b = [0,0,0,0,0,1]
c = [0,0,2,2,2,1]
l = [a,b,c]
f = MorphismsOfPartitions(b,a)
g = MorphismsOfPartitions(c,b)

then the following identity should formally hold: 

tree_of_partitions(l) = [f, g]

or more graphically: l = [a <-- b:f, b <-- c:g]
